## Team Capacity:
 - In our initial plan, one estimate point stands for half an hour to one hour of smooth coding, which here means work without bugs and confusion. We now have more experience and knowledge on the software so we plan to complete more points this sprint. The estimated time for each member is around 3 hours a day. In sprint 2, we are going to do 80-points work.

## Spikes:
 - We didnâ€™t have that much experience or knowledge with relationships between tables, so it took quite some time to figure out how that works to form relationships between different tables, for example between company_inventory and customer_cart.
 - We also had insufficient knowledge about linking the backend and frontend for company inventory as it was difficult to display what is received from the backend dynamically, for example the list of items in a store.
