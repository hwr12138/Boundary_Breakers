Our product has 2 main competitors. First, there is mappedin (https://www.mappedin.com/industries/grocery/) and second there is aisle411 (http://www.aisle411.com/shops/). Both of these companies have apps that are aimed to a similar problem that we are aiming to solve which is finding products easily.

For mappedin and aisle411 they have an application for mapping and navigating grocery stores. The majority of features are similar and have overlap with our product such as creating a map for navigating, and having route planning. 

However, one feature that they are missing is finding items on the go. These apps require users to add items to their grocery list and go on a planned route. For us, we let users that are in a rush to not go through the lengthy process and instead have an instant search. The users that this benefits are those who use this app for finding products they need in a rush.

We think that they did not target these users as they cater towards a user base that is more well planned (perhaps people going on a weekly planned trip versus an emergency trip).
