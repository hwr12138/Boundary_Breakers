# How did you organize the team?

At the start of each sprint, including sprint 0, the tasks are dividened evenly based on each member's interest and skills. If there is any conflict in the division of the task, the team discussion is carried out on who should get the task. If we do not reach any consencus as a team, voting/coinflip is done to decide who gets the task.

# Which tools did you use, if any

We use Google docs to share documents that contain written work, so that everyone in the team can read and edit the file if needed. 

We used Figma to design our UI/UX design, SQLite for backend and Flutter for frontend framework and may add or change to different tools in the future if need arises. 

# How did you make decisions?

Suggestions or changes are welcomed from everyone in the group, but decisions were made together, where everyone or majority of us must be in favor for the allocation of a task and during the submission of the task. If there is an important decision to be made, we would hold a meeting and discuss and try to reach a consensus in case of disagreement.
In the case, where we are unable to reach the consensus and need more clarification, we would reach out to TAs and instructor for help.

# How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?

Our user stories are prioritized based in the order of most important to the least. We first work on the user stories that lay the foundation of our project. Then we prioritize based on features that are the next priority and so on. If required, we will consider other features on the priority based on the scope of this project. 

# How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

We use planning poker for point estimation of the tasks. Our discussions, and suggestions as a group mostly lead to consensus. If there is a conflict, we decided to go through voting (max three rounds) to reach a consensus. We like to have a majority vote to move forward. If this is not possible, then we go with the option having most number of votes (No ties, since 7 member team). 

# How frequently did you meet?

We decided to meet thrice a week, but additional meetings can be arranged or held as needed. We meet on Wednesdays at 6:30 pm, Fridays at 9 am and Saturdays at 9 am (sprint planning meetings) to discuss the work we have done so far, approve the final version to be submitted, planning for the next sprint, discuss and  resolve any conflicts and help each other. 

# What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

* We will be more diligent to define our goals and milestones clearly and scheduling them earlier to avoid any time constraints so that we have time to make small modifications before the final submission.

* During the meetings, We need to give chance to everyone and listen to their ideas.

* Meetings were more effective when a team member was leading the meeting.
