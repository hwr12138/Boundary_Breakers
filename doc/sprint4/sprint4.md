## Sprint 4 Planning Meeting: 

 - This meeting was held on 7th Nov,2021 using Microsoft Teams. This meeting was to decide on the tasks to complete for sprint 4 and breaking those tasks into subtasks to assign to each team member.

---

### Sprint goal:
 - Finish user stories related to path routing and some UI improvements.

---

## User stories for Sprint 4:
- BOUNB-13 RouteByPath
- BOUNB-15 RouteByStore
- BOUNB-21 AppUI
- BOUNB-79 Map Improvement

---

## Team Capacity:
 - In our initial plan, one estimate point stands for half an hour to one hour of smooth coding, which here means work without bugs and confusion. The estimated time for each member is around 3 hours a day. Since this is the last sprint, we will complete the remaining features and plan to do 113-points work.

## Spikes:
 - It was difficult to make an efficient route in the backend, as the algorithms would have to take into account the distances and the physical location of the shelves. We solved this problem by using our fixed layout so we knew how far each shelf was from one another.

 - There was also some difficulty showing the item dots on the store map. Since the dot has to show up physically on top of the correct aisle and in the correct shelf location.
