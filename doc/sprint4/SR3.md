## Participants: 
Chang Liu, Haowen Rui, Hayden Mak, Hrithik Kumar Advani, Johnson Su, Nimra Maqbool, Raymond Ho

## Unfinished tasks and group them into stories: 
We completed all the user stories from Sprint 3

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint:
- Meet regularly as outlined in the team-contract.md
- Conduct the sprint retrospective and next sprint planning meeting as soon as possible once the sprint finishes
- Distributing our work based on individual's expertise and distribute the work evenly
- Work on helping each other depending on our research and expertise.

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint:
- Make sure we highlight the feature number in commit messages each time we commit
- Create clear documentation to make sure frontend and backend can collaborate easily
- Distribute the tasks clearly so everyone knows what to do by when

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint:
- Not distributing work clearly so we don't know how to do work individually
- Tasks having overlap

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 3:
- Finishing our all user stories for sprint 3
- Learning the new technologies in the short period of time
- Fixing some troublesome bugs
