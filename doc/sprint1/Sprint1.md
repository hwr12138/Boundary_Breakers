## Sprint 1 Planning Meeting: 

 - This meeting is held on 25th Sept,2021 by using Miscrosoft Teams. This meeting is to decide the estimate point per feature and allocate tasks to team members. In the meeting, we first discussed the estimate point for each feature. Then we separated tasks into subtasks and most tasks are separated by frontend and backend. Every team member gets their responsible tasks to work on.

 - BOUNB-7 CompanySignUp
 - BOUNB-8 CompanyProfile
 - BOUNB-30 Company Account Screen
 - BOUNB-38 USer Choice UI

## Team Capacity:
 - In our initial plan, one estimate point stands for half an hour to one hour smooth coding, which smooth here means work without bugs and confusion. We try to allocate tasks around 8 estimate points  for each of us. Considering we need time to get used to the new softwares and we are very likely to have bugs, the estimated time for each member is around 2 hours a day. In sprint1, we are going to do 52-points work.

## Spikes:
 - When building the navigation bar flutter component, we created a BottomNavigationBar component that generates 4 different buttons on the bottom of the homepage, when any button is clicked, it shows the corresponding page on top of the screen. our original implementation was using a flat button, which includes a transition effect we didn't want, so we got rid of it and embraced the current method.
 - When trying to communicate with Django via HTTP requests, we did not know how to handle it, so we conducted research to find out how to send a HTTP request from flutter and how to accept it in Django. Also, we learned how to parse the JSON response from Django sent back to Flutter.
