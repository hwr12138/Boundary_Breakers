## Document the meeting: 

 - The release planning meeting is held on Septemeber 19, 2021 by using Miscrosoft Teams. All of our team members attended the release planning meeting. In this meeting, we came up with the idea to do our own project 'smart grocery map' and determined its features with a simple prototype for the app. We also discuss our target users, future needs for store information, and how are we going to implement all the features.

## Release Goal: 
For our release goal, we want to help users to generate an optimal shopping map. Our target users are those who don't wish to spend time hanging around in the store, and those who are not familiar with how to get their wanted items. We aim to provide them with an easy-to-use platform. Users should be able to use our app to search information about specific items and stores, or check any changes of items. They can also make customized routes that can direct them where to find items in the store.
