## Sprint 3 Planning Meeting: 

 - This meeting was held on 24th Oct,2021 using Microsoft Teams. This meeting was to decide on the tasks to complete for sprint 3 and breaking those tasks into subtasks to assign to each team member.

---

### Sprint goal:
 - Finish user stories related to filtering for items, viewing items on a store map and some UI improvements.

---

## User stories for Sprint 3:
- BOUNB-12 FilterByItem
- BOUNB-20 MakeMap
- BOUNB-70 UI Improvements

---

## Team Capacity:
 - In our initial plan, one estimate point stands for half an hour to one hour of smooth coding, which here means work without bugs and confusion. The estimated time for each member is around 3 hours a day. With more experience and knowledge with the software, we plan to do 61-points work.

## Spikes:
 - We didnâ€™t have that much experience or knowledge with creating a layout creation tool so we had to do research on how to approach the idea. We ended up making each store have the same fixed layout which is not ideal but is what we settled on due to our limited experience and knowledge.
 - We also had to do some research for implementing a search bar which dynamically retrieves results and updates as the search input changes.
