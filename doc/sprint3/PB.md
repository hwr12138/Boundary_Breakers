# Inventory Edit
### CheckItem:
As Joan Green(the administrator), I would like to check the modified information about the price, location, and description of an item in the database before displaying that to the customers, so that I can ensure the information on the app is reliable.

- CoS: If the request to change the information is refused by the administrator, the modifier will get a notification about it.
- CoS: If the request to change the information is accepted by the administrator, the backend database will modify as the wanted(update, create, delete).
